# Stroke Prediction Model
The Stroke Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system that predicts whether an individual is at risk of experiencing a stroke. By considering various features such as gender, age, BMI, heart disease, hypertension, marital status, work type, smoking status, and residence type.


## Installation

you have to install all the libraries below from your terminal to be able to run the code successfully:

- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install plotly
- pip install sklearn
- pip install feature_engine
- pip install xgboost
- pip install lightgbm
- pip install catboost
- pip install collection
- pip install gradio

## Features

- Multidimensional approach: The model integrates ten important features, including gender, age, BMI, heart disease, hypertension, marital status, work type, smoking status, and residence type, to assess stroke risk accurately.

- Data preprocessing: The provided libraries facilitate data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

- Modeling: The model employs logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier,Catboost,LGBM Classifier,and XGBoost algorithms to train and predict stroke risk.

- Evaluation metrics: The model evaluates performance using confusion matrix, accuracy score and mean absolute error.

- Feature engineering: Feature engineering techniques like ordinal encoding , (one-hot encoding and scaling in the logistic regression part) are employed to enhance model performance.
